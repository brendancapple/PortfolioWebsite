            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>
                As an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and graduate of North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, I've dedicated the majority of my life to academics.
                However, everyone has hobbies, and I'm no exception.
                This website is a testament to those joys in my life, from drawing to programming and rocketry.
                Incidentally, this has resulted in a website well suited for a portfolio, and so, it will be published under that name.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Defining myself is a strange and painful task.
                    It's fundamentally reductive in a way that I can't fully describe.
                    I'm a twin and a child of divorce, but neither fact greatly influences my life anymore.
                    I'm in love with programming but drawing is my oldest friend, and writing is a close second.
                    These facts dance with dualities to imply depth, but neither actually captures who I am.
                    I could dedicate more words, but they would only create the illusion of certainty where none truly exists.
                    That would be impossible for mere words a page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, that ultimately doesn't matter.
                    For, I, like everyone, am a product of what I enjoy: books, video games, anime, art, and computers.
                    How could I not try and make the same?
