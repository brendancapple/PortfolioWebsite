            <p>This is the example project for the forum I taught about C++ in my senior year of highschool. This is not exactly what the students in this course made, however it is a good example of what their final products should have looked like.</p>

            <p>Playback is slow, as the console is trying to print each character individually in quick succession. A more efficient design would create a string, then print it. However, this project was for teaching purposes, and not practical applications, and this allowed us to more quickly move from displaying the text to library management.</p>
