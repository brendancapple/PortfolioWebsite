# Portfolio Website
Brendan Apple

This is a portfolio website coded in exclusively HTML, CSS, and JS. 
It holds all my recent art, coding projects, and model rockets. 
Some showcase or downloadable files are in Matlab, Mathematica, GLSL, etc, so this project doesn't appear as pure HTML.

I had a lot of fun making this, despite it not being the modern standard for web-design.
I figured all my other projects will have to use frameworks, specific coding paradigms, etc, so this would be my best chance to try this approach to web-dev.
