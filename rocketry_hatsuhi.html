                    <p>
                        Hatsuhi was my Level 1 Certification Rocket.

                        It flew twice: my certification flight in Virginia, and a camera-carrying flight in Dalzell, SC.
                        The first flight was successful, both launching and landing without any issue. 
                        The second flight launched perfectly, but I lost sight of it mid-flight and could not find it afterward.
                        True to it's name "First Fire" refused to fly again.

            <p>This is the research paper I wrote in the summer between my junior and senior years of highschool in NCSSM's Summer Research Experience in Computational Science program. It studies the difference in translation quality between traditional neural network and large language model translations of Japanese text. Apart from some advice and input from my advisor, Robert Gotwals, this paper was entirely my work. Due to attempting publication in a couple of papers, I will not provide the paper in full until about a year from now. </p>
