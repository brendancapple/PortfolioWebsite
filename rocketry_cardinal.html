                    <p>
                        Cardinal is NCSSM HPR's 2024 Level 2 Payload-Driven Rocket. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is NCSSM's first full foray into member-driven payloads for a high-powered rocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has flown twice: its maiden flight in spring and its redemption flight with in the fall.
                        On its first flight, Cardinal launched and returned safely, but it spun dangerously in the wind and many of the payloads failed.
                        Thus, we relaunched it in the fall with a more even internal weight distribution and improved payloads.
                        The second launch went much better, though some of the payloads still failed as the responsible members weren't at launch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now retired, Cardinal hangs in the Reynolds Breezeway at NCSSM.

                <p>
                    Cardinal is a variable diameter Blue Tube (vulcanized cardboard) rocket, 63in in length.
                    The aft section is 3in in diameter to hold the 54mm motor mount and recovery system, composed of a 48in main chute, a 12in drogue, and two blue raven altimeters.
                    The fore section is 4in in diameter and tapers into the fiberglass nosecone.
                    This held the payloads, which are elaborated upon in a later section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cardinal's transitions are 3D-printed and not structural, with a series of spaced centering rings handling the forces.
                    All structural components were made of fiberglass, Blue Tube, or 1/4-inch birch plywood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cardinal's fins are carbon-fiber composite. 
                    They're shaped by a laser-cut sheet of birch plywood with two 3D-printed wedges, which are super-glued onto the fins and aligned by hand.
                    One layer of carbon fiber, and two layers of fiberglass are laminated onto the fins via a food-preserving vacuum sealer.
                    A layer of release plastic separates this composite from cotton wadding that absorbs excess epoxy.
                    Once laminated, excess carbon fiber was cut and sanded away, leaving the completed fins.

                <h2>Payloads</h2>
                <p>
                    Cardinal has three payloads, a GPS, a camera, and an atmospheric data sensor array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The payloads each have 3d printed enclosures with their own batteries and screw switches, all strung together on a threaded metal rod.
                    This ensured even if one payload failed, the rest could continue operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I did not work on the other payloads beyond coordinating the payload bay, their descriptions are omitted.
                    See the NCSSM HPR Webstite for details.
                </p>

                <h3>Atmospheric Data Suite</h3>
                <p>
                    I was the primary creator of this payload, doing most of the design and coding work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An adafruit feather controlled a suite of sensors, including an SHT31 thermometer-humidistat, SGP30 air quality sensor, VEML7700 lux sensor, and BNO055 accelerometer, to record data to an SD card.
                    All circuit boards were connected via I2C and soldiered onto prototyping boards, which slid into the payload enclosure.
                    Other sensors were planned, but could not be implemented in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were two main issues with this design. 
                    First, the battery (which was regulated by the feather prior to powering the shared power rail) did not have a high enough voltage for some of the sensors to work reliably.
                    This led to unreliability in the air quality sensor, which relies on voltage for sensing.
                    Second, the VEML7700 board was mounted too close to the outside of its enclosure, thus stopping the enclosure from fitting in the payload bay.
                    This was resolved by sanding the circuit board. 
                    However, the first attempt at this irreparably damaged the sensor, so a replacement was needed and the light sensor did not operate on the first launch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power was controlled via a screw switch mounted to the enclosure, which completed the battery circuit when engaged. 
                </p>

                    This payload's data collection was successful! 
                    It captured the rocket's spin and acceleration, displayed the temperature reduction from its velocity, and demonstrated the launch's minimal impact on air pollutant levels.
